# cucumber-demo
This repo is created to demo how to configure Cucumber integration testing framework to a SpringBoot with TestNG project.

After cloned
$ mvn clean install

To run 
$ mvn spring-boot:run
This application defaults to port 9095

The project is configured to be run by TestNG plugin through an IDE of choice (Eclipse is used to developed this project).
It is expected that the application is up and running on port 9095 during test runtime.
